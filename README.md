# MARKDOWN Cheatsheet

## Aims
The aim of this file is to provide a quick reference for me to use, and help encourage me to provide as much documentation as possible. Documentation to assist both me as author, and potential users/contributors as my projects develop.

Initially this will just be an *aide memoire*, but as I learn it will hopefully develop into a complete learning tool to help others learn **Markdown**q

## What is Markdown?
Essentially, the development of Markdown was an attempt to make writing content of webpages an easier task - both for the author and anyone examining that code.

Using `html` requires a steep learning curve of `tags` and header declarations in order to conform to web standards. Simple text-based web pages including technical documentation, README files, blogs and many other situations do not require complicated word processors or html knowledge.

Markdown is a method used to convert text to html so that more visually interesting content can more easily be achieved.
